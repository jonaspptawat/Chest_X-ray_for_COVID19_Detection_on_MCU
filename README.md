# Chest X-ray for COVID19 Detection on MCU

A very small DL model (0.3MB) that be able to run on most microcontrollers and other memory constrained devices. 
It can detect a COVID-19 via Chest x-ray images (96x96) using TensorFlow Lite C++ API.
However, the dataset that i use for training this DL model is from [this kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andyczhao/covidx-cxr2)(Thanks for this dataset to make this project happen :D). Moreover, i also have a notebook where i train this DL model which you can find [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonaspptawat/covid-x-ray-using-small-model-0-3mb-83-acc).
